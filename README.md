# Learning Rust

This repository is basically a way to practice the exercises that are described on [The Rust Programming Language book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/title-page.html)
and also trying to put in practice other concepts of Rust programming language applying on programmes using my own
ideas.

The main idea here was turning it into a simple CLI application, where you can select an option to run an example
that represents an exercise or just an idea on how put in practice many of the Rust data types to then better
understand how they work.

In summary:

- **project purposes**: studying, play
- **user interface**: CLI
- **features**:
    - the guessing game;
    - a random example of how to use structs, enums and pattern matching;

## Dependencies

This project depends only on Rust and Cargo, so to be able to run it locally, follow the instructions from
[Getting Started section on the book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch01-00-getting-started.html) to be able to install both.

## Run locally

Simply clone this project and run on you terminal the command `cargo run`.
